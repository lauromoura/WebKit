// On Android, WebDriver is built as a shared library, and the process is spawned
// from the Java side, which calls into a C++ function using JNI, and that in turn
// jumps into the entry point. The mangled name is used directly, from the code at
// https://github.com/Igalia/wpe-android/blob/b918e3f8b86eda406436cb251c2e7b10a529008c/wpeview/src/main/cpp/Service/EntryPoint.cpp#L55
